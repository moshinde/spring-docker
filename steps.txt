Here imp is i have created a network of containers and mapped the ip addresses to those containers and used them in application.properties file

created db server image as follows 
Didnot map port as i have used ip address of container and port on which mysql installed in application.properties of SPRING BOOT
docker run -dit --name dbserver --net spring-docker-mysql --ip 172.18.0.3 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=Margery@123 -e MYSQL_DATABASE=spring_docker mysql:5.6


Pulled openJDK8 image and then deployed jar file
from which we created webserver image and exposed port on which jar file would run and then mapped that port to port of host
Here we need to take care of port of container on which we will run our JAR file and that need to be specified in application.properties as server.port=5556
docker run -dit --name webserver --net spring-docker-mysql --ip 172.18.0.2 -p5556:5556 webserver-image
